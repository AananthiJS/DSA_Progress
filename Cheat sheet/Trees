Use two pointers:
If the problem feels like it’s flowing from one traversal and being shaped by another, that’s your cue to assign one pointer to each.

You use two pointers in trees when:

You’re dealing with two different roles in two different lists — and they need to “meet each other” in the recursive flow.

Example: For 105. Construct a Binary Tree with Inorder and Preorder lists.

preIdx: "Here’s the next root. Let me build it now."
inIdx: "Are we at the end of the left subtree yet?"
limit: "Don’t you dare build past me. When you see me in inorder, STOP."
